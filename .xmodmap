!Clear all the mods for later usage
!Clear caps lock

!Default mod1 is: Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x6c),  Meta_L (0xcd)
!Let us remove Meta_L
add mod1 = Alt_L Alt_R

!Change the right windows key to Hyper_R (just because Hyper_R was available)
!And finally assign Hyper_R to mod4
keycode 134 = Hyper_R
add mod5 = Hyper_R

keycode 66 = Control_L
add control = Control_L Control_R
