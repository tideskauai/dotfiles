# Hard and symbolic links {{{
A hard link can only reference files that are in the same file system. It provides
a reference to the file's physical index (inode). Hard links do not break when you
move the original file around because the hard links point to file's physical data
rather than its location in the file structure. Users are not required to have access
rights to the original file in order to use the link. If original file gets deleted,
all hard links will become broken.

A symlink, or symbolic link, points to the file's location in the file system. Symlinks
can be in other file systems, and even point to files in a remote file system. The user
is required to have access rights to the original file in order to access/use the symlink.
If original file gets deleted, all symlinks become broken.

By default "ln" will make a hard link. 
To make symlinks, "ln -s" is required.
