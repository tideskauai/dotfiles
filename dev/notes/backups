# Full Backup:
It is the simplest form of a backup, since all it does is to copy files from $SOURCE to $DESTINATION.
Pros: Easy and quick to restore.
Cons: Most time consuming, most space-intensive, less flexible.

# Differential:
A differential backup only backs-up the _files_ that have changed since the last full backup. 
Pros: Less space-intensive
Cons:

# Incremental:
An incremental backup only backs-up the _changes_ that have changed since last backup. All backups depend
upon each other, so if one of the incremental or full backup gets deleted, restoring becomes impossible.
Pros: Least space-intensive.
Cons: Hard and slow to restore, reliability.
