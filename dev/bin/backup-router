# in the path defined in backup_dir.
# Explanation: This script will grab the list of all files under $backup_dir
# and scp them from remote host(rhost).
# FIXME: Instead of iteraing over the list of files to backup, thus, runnign scp
# multiple times, run scp only one time with the list of all files to backup.
